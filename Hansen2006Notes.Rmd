# Abstract: 
![*Abstract of Hansen et al (2006)*](C:/Users/Matthiew/Documents/Research/Candidacy/JournalClub/CandidacyJournalClub/Hansen2006Abstract.png)  

The methods from @HwangEtAl+shortyear are described in detail here.

# Intro  
- 50% of variance in PTC detection threshold is due to genetic differences  
- 3 SNPs/5 haplotypes in TAS2R38 on chromosome 7
- aim to investigate "extent of genetic covariation" among sensitivity to PROP, SOA, quinine, and caffeine

# Methods
## Taste test
- 5 bitter samples, presented twice
  - $2*10^{-4}\ M$ SOA
  - $1.81*10^{-4}\ M$ quinine HCl
  - $0.050 \ M$ caffeine
  - $6.0*10^{-4}\ M$ PROP
  - $4.99*10^{-6}\ M$ denatonium benzoate
- presentation of the samples were all the same for all participants
  + different presentation for replicate
- presentation of the bitter samples were interwoven with water and sweet solutions
- a dry PROP strip was also presented (not analyzed in @Hansen2006 but in @HwangEtAl+shortyear)
- analyzed taste sensation on LMS (@greenEvaluatingLabeledMagnitude1996 and '93)
- Procedure
  - swish for 5 s, spit
  - rate intensity on LMS
  - rate taste quality (5 basic taste)
  - rinse, repeat

## Data Screening and Modeling
- those who total scores were < 200 (average slightly above weak) or > 1800 mm (slightly below strongest imaginable)
- total 705 participants
- denatonium benzoate shwoed bimodal distribution (unable to be transformed in a way that didn't violate the assumption of normality for data analysis)
- covariates included: age, sex, history of head injury, history of ear infection, smoking behavior, perfume/cologne/aftershave use)
  + significant fixed covariates would be applied to the multivariate modeling
  
# Results
- clustering from @Delwiche2001 seems to hold here, correlations between SOA, quinine, and caff; also lack of correlation of PROP to other bitter compounds
- significant fixed effects (covariates) included age, sex, ear infection history, presentation order
  + bitterness sensitivity decreases with increasing age
  + sex effect: males found SOA more intense (sig); females found quinine more intense (NS)
  + ear infection history tended to increase bitter sensitivity (increased scores)
- MZ twins correlations were high for each bitter taste phenotype, suggesting genetic influence
  + SOA, quinine, caff correlations were more than doubled
    + suggests "nonadditive genetic influence"
  + PROP correlations were half than DZ twin correlations
    + suggests "common environmental factors"
- modeling had low power to detect common environmental factors (C) and discriminate additive genetic (A) and non-additive genetic (D) factors
- heritability estimates were 0.72 for PROP, 0.28 for SOA, 0.34 for quinine, and 0.30 for caffeine
  + increased heritability estimate means direct/indirect genetic variation accounts for the variation in the trait ([Neele Lab](https://www.nealelab.is/blog/2017/9/13/heritability-101-what-is-heritability#:~:text=A%20high%20heritability%2C%20close%20to,to%20be%20informative%20%5B4%5D.))
  
# Discussion
- no general/common single factor influenced all four compounds (SOA, PROP, quinine, caff)
  + one common genetic group was responsible for the GV of SOA, quinine, caff, responsible for 22-28% of the variation in that cluster (cf @Delwiche2001)
- the genetic factor accounting for 72% of the variation in PROP sensitivity only accounted for 1% of SOA and 2% of caffeine
- low power in modeling certain factors could lead to inflated heritability estimates
  + likely due to sample size and data screening process
