# Abstract: 
![*Abstract of Bush and Moore (2012)*](C:/Users/Matthiew/Documents/Research/Candidacy/JournalClub/Bush2012Abstract.png)  

# Glossary/Abbreviations:
- haplotype - a group of SNPs ([NIH lecture](https://youtu.be/HHvdupHgeFg?si=zvgAl1gHi0-YxVmt))  
- TAS2R - a gene  
- T2R - a protein  
- multivariate associated analysis  
- genome-wide association study (GWAS) - aim to identify genetic risk factors for common diseases by utilizing DNA sequence variations (@BushMoore+shortyear)  
- minor allele frequency (MAF) - frequency of the less common allele in a SNP (@BushMoore+shortyear)  
- pleiotropy  
- single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP): a single change in a base pair, seen/occur with high frequency, common, given in terms of minor allele frequency  (@BushMoore+shortyear)  
- linkage disequilibrium (LD): if 2 pairs are always seen together (at higher than chance level) (ex. AB and ab) out of possible combinations (AB, Ab, aB, ab), distance between 2 genes is assumed to be small  
- mutation - low frequency variation in genetic sequence, rare (@BushMoore+shortyear)

# 1. Important Questions in Human Genetics
- GWAS studies aim to identify genetic risk factors for common diseases by utilizing DNA sequence variations  
  + the goal/outcome is to identify biological underpinnings of disease susceptibility, predict at-risk groups, and develop new prevention/treatments
  + could have a role in "personalizing medicine"
  + [**self**] I like this definition
- ex. application of GWAS: warfarin dosages are partially controlled by genetics  

# 2. Concepts Underlying the Study Design
