[Meghan Hall](https://meghan.rbind.io/blog/2022-06-28-a-beginners-guide-to-mixed-effects-models/) explains mixed effects models.

- in linear regression, a basic assumption is independence  
- *fixed effects* - your "normal" dependent variables, assume IP has impact on DP  
- *random effects* - categorical variables to control for  
  + do not need to know/understand their impact on the DP    
  + can help remove bias from fixed effects

This [tutorial](https://mfviz.com/hierarchical-models/) explains it simply and beautifully, with visualizations.
