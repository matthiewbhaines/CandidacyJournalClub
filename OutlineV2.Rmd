# Outline:

1.  review some basic taste biology and genetics  
2.  review and critique @Hwang2018  

# PROP as a case study  

## Discovering PROP  

-   "problem" of variability in bitter taste perception started in 1932 (@Genick2011)  
-   Arthur Fox reported inter-subject variability in PTC perception (@Genick2011)  
    -   discrete categories of "taster" (sensitive) and "non-taster" (in-sensitive)  
-   PTC is toxic (not great for human science), so PROP has widely replaced PTC  
    -   PROP acts in a similar manner to PTC
-   both PROP and PTC are agonists of *TAS2R38*

## Biology Review
- "taster status" of PROP is the result of your **phenotype**
  + the expression of a certain trait
- phenotype is the result of your **genotype**  
  + the genetic make up or specific combination of alleles
  + alleles are one of the versions of gene

\

- can see the alleles here are **T** and **C**    
- rs10246939 (on chromosome 7)
  + explains ~50% of variance seen in detection thresholds (@Genick2011)  
  + this SNP here has a MAF of ~46% (@Genick2011)
- this is at a **SNP**, or single nucleotide polymorphism  
  + a SNP is a single change in a base pair, resulting in genetic variation  
  + usually high frequency (@Bush2012)  
  + *mutations* are generally reserved for low frequency genetic variation (@Bush2012)

## Other factors influencing PROP sensitivity   
From @Robino2022:  

  -   fungiform pappilae count/density
  -   age
  -   gender
  -   salivary flow rate and protein composition
  
## Previous GWAS study (@Reed2010)
-   Previous GWAS showed signal at TAS2R38 (rs10246939)
    -   also showed TAS2R19 for quinine on chromosome 12
    -   NS for caffeine/SOA
    -   no other proposed loci for PROP on chromosomes 5 or 16
