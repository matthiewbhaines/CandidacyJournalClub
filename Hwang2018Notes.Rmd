# Abstract: 
![*Abstract of Hwang et al. (2018)*](C:/Users/Matthiew/Documents/Research/Candidacy/JournalClub/CandidacyJournalClub/Hwang18Abstract.png)  

# Glossary/Abbreviations:
- haplotype  
- TAS2R  
- T2R  
- multivariate associated analysis  
- genome-wide association study (GWAS)  
- minor allele frequency (MAF)  
- pleiotropy  
  
# Introduction  
- bitterness perception is partially determined by genetics  
  + genetic effect is estimated to be between 36% and 73%
- *TAS2R* is a gene; *T2R* is the protein product
- what is a **haplotype**?
- PROP is associated with TAS2R38
- Quinine (Q) is associated with TAS2R19
- this study aims to $\uparrow$ N (sample size) and use multivariate associated analysis (?) to identify common genetic variances (minor allele frequency [MAF] $\geq$ 5%) with small effects  
  + what is the "plain English" version?
- using MV GWAS can find associations that didn't reach significance in univariate analysis
