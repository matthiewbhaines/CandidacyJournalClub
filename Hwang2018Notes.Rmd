# Abstract: 
![*Abstract of Hwang et al. (2018)*](C:/Users/Matthiew/Documents/Research/Candidacy/JournalClub/CandidacyJournalClub/Hwang18Abstract.png)  

# Glossary/Abbreviations:
- haplotype - a group of SNPs ([NIH lecture](https://youtu.be/HHvdupHgeFg?si=zvgAl1gHi0-YxVmt))  
- TAS2R - a gene  
- T2R - a protein  
- multivariate associated analysis  
- genome-wide association study (GWAS) - aim to identify genetic risk factors for common diseases by utilizing DNA sequence variations (@BushMoore+shortyear)  
- minor allele frequency (MAF) - frequency of the less common allele in a SNP (@BushMoore+shortyear)  
- pleiotropy  
- single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP): a single change in a base pair, seen/occur with high frequency, common, given in terms of minor allele frequency  (@BushMoore+shortyear)  
- linkage disequilibrium (LD): if 2 pairs are always seen together (at higher than chance level) (ex. AB and ab) out of possible combinations (AB, Ab, aB, ab), distance between 2 genes is assumed to be small  
- mutation - low frequency variation in genetic sequence, rare (@BushMoore+shortyear)
- susceptibility variant
- penetrance - effect size (of a genetic variant) (@BushMoore+shortyear)

# Introduction  
- bitterness perception is partially determined by genetics  
  + genetic effect is estimated to be between 36% and 73%
- *TAS2R* is a gene; *T2R* is the protein product
- bitter taste perception has been correlated with disease status and certain surgical outcomes, so it is important to understand bitterness perception in the interest in personalizing medicine  
- what is a **haplotype**?
- PROP is associated with TAS2R38
- Quinine (Q) is associated with TAS2R19
- this study aims to $\uparrow$ N (sample size) and use multivariate associated analysis (?) to identify common genetic variances (minor allele frequency [MAF] $\geq$ 5%) with small effects  
  + what is the "plain English" version?
- using MV GWAS can find associations that didn't reach significance in univariate analysis

  + 1A: spread on y axis, not on x axis
    + only T1 (y axis) is associated with variant (non-pleiotropic)
    + better separation seen in 2D (practice with the pencil test from high school math class)
  + 1B: spread on y and x axis
    + minor allele has opposing effects, $\uparrow$ T1 (Y) and $\downarrow$ T2 (X)
    + starting to see the spread on y and x axes, especially when combined
  + 1C: minor allele has similar effects, $\uparrow$ T1 (Y) and $\uparrow$ T2 (X)
    + no greater separation with bivariate analysis than would get with univariate
    
- what is/are the hypotheses when conducting a GWAS?
