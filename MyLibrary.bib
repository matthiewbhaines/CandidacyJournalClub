               provide practical guidelines for the design of future GWAS
               studies on chemosensory phenotypes. Moreover, in addition to the
               TAS2R38 gene past studies have implicated a number of other
               genetic loci to affect taste sensitivity to PROP and the related

               single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For caffeine and SOA, no
               SNP association reached a genome-wide statistical criterion. For

abstract = {Abstract Over the course of the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutionised our understanding of complex disease genetics. One of the diseases that has benefitted most from this technology has been Crohn's disease (CD), with the identification of autophagy, the IL-17/IL-23 axis and innate lymphoid cells as key players in CD pathogenesis. Our increasing understanding of the genetic architecture of CD has also highlighted how a failure to suppress aberrant immune responses may contribute to disease development – a realisation that is now being incorporated into the design of new treatments. However, despite these successes, a significant proportion of disease heritability remains unexplained. Similarly, most of the causal variants at associated loci have not yet been identified, and even fewer have been functionally characterised. Because of the inarguable rise in the incidence of CD in regions of the world that previously had low disease rates, GWAS studies will soon have to shift from a largely Caucasian focus to include populations from other ethnic backgrounds. Future studies should also move beyond conventional studies of disease susceptibility into phenotypically driven ‘within-cases’ analyses in order to explore the role of genetics in other important aspects of disease biology. These studies are likely to include assessments of prognosis and/or response to treatments and may be critical if personalised medicine is ever to become a reality.},

Here we performed a genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) using a 40\% larger sample (n = 1999) together with a bivariate approach to detect previously unidentified common variants with small effects on bitter perception.
Results: We identified two signals, both with small effects ({\textless} 2\%), within the bitter taste receptor clusters on chromosomes 7 and 12, which influence the perceived bitterness of denatonium benzoate and sucrose octaacetate respectively. We also provided the first independent replication for an association of caffeine bitterness on chromosome 12. Furthermore, we provided evidence for pleiotropic effects on quinine, caffeine, sucrose octaacetate and denatonium benzoate for the three {SNPs} on chromosome 12 and the functional importance of the {SNPs} for denatonium benzoate bitterness.
Conclusions: These findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of bitter taste and offer a useful starting point for determining the biological pathways linking perception of bitter substances.},

Moreover saliva contains enzymes and molecules that can interact with food. To date, little research has been devoted to the intra- and inter-individual variabilities of these components and their inter-relationships. The first aim of this work was to study intra- and inter-individual variabilities over time in the composition of molecules likely to interact with food in the mouth, with particular focus on molecules that might interact with fat. The second aim was to try to relate this composition to a liking for fat and its perception. Stimulated and unstimulated saliva from 13 subjects was collected in the morning and afternoon on three occasions at 4-month intervals. Saliva characteristics such as flow, protein concentration, lipolysis, proteolysis, amylolysis, lipocalin concentration, lysozyme activity, total antioxidant status and uric acid concentrations were measured, as well as the liking for and perceived fattiness of a fat solution. The results showed that for most of the measured characteristics, intra-subject variability in saliva composition was smaller than inter-subject variability, with remarkable stability over time (8 months) in terms of flow, lypolysis, proteolysis and total antioxidant status. Relationships were found between some of these characteristics (lipolysis, lipocalin and flow) and fat-liking or perception, showing that the composition of saliva may play an important role in fat perception and liking. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Polymorphisms in the {TAS}2R38 gene provide insight to phenotypes long associated 6-n-propylthiouracil ({PROP}) and phenylthiocarbamide bitterness. We tested relationships between {TAS}2R38 genotype, taste phenotype, and fungiform papillae ({FP}) number in 139 females and 59 males (age range 21-60 years), primarily of European ancestry. {DNA} was analyzed for 3 polymorphic sites, identifying common (alanine-valine-isoleucine [{AVI}/{AVI}], heterozygotes, proline-alanine-valine [{PAV}/{PAV}]) and rare (proline-valine-isoleucine, alanine-alanine-valine, {AAI}) forms. Individuals with {PROP} threshold {\textgreater}0.15 {mM} were almost exclusively {AVI}/{AVI}; those with threshold {\textless}0.1 {mM} could have any genotype. {PAV}/{PAVs} were more difficult to identify with {PROP} taste measures, although perceived bitterness of moderate {PROP} concentrations (0.32, 1 {mM}) had better correspondence with genotype than did threshold. For {AVI}/{AVIs}, increases in bitterness from 1 to 3.2 {mM} {PROP} nearly paralleled those of {TAS}2R38 heterozygotes and {PAV}/{PAVs}. Some bitterness gains were related to {FP} number sampled from a standard area on the tongue tip, yet the {PROP} bitterness-{FP} relationship differed across genotype. Among homozygotes, {FP} was a significant determinant of {PROP} bitterness; heterozygotes showed a flat relationship. Those tasting concentrated {PROP} as more bitter also tasted concentrated sucrose, citric acid, sodium chloride, and quinine as more intense, even after statistically controlling for {TAS}2R38 genotype, {FP}, and intensity of tones (nonoral standard). To summarize, although {PROP} threshold generally exhibited single-gene complete dominance, {PROP} bitterness may involve additional bitter receptors as evidenced by misclassification of some nontaster homozygotes and the bitterness functions for concentrated {PROP}. Variability in receptor expression may explain attenuated bitterness-{FP} relationships. {PROP} bitterness does associate with heightened taste sensations (i.e., supertasting), but this is not due to {TAS}2R38 polymorphisms.

In the past, bitterness reduction was focused on pharmaceuticals and drugs; however, more recently, the most intense research is performed on the reduction of bitter or astringent taste in functional food or beverage applications. These foods and beverages possess inherent off-tastes due to fortification with healthy but poor-tasting actives. During the last 10 years, tremendous progress in the elucidation of bitter taste reception and transduction on the cellular level was made and many new molecules and compounds to reduce bitter off-tastes were reported. The following review will be focused on the advances, in the area of bitter-masking molecules, during the last 10 years. It will not cover other debittering strategies such as process optimization or biotransformations to reduce the amount of bitter ingredients, encapsulation, and other physical formulation technologies. The review will close with a short comparative study of various bitter maskers and some suggestions for flavor development of poor-tasting ingredients.},

	abstract = {Bitter taste stimuli are detected by a diverse family of G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs}) expressed in gustatory cells. Each bitter taste receptor ({TAS}2R) responds to an array of compounds, many of which are toxic and can be found in nature. For example, human {TAS}2R16 ({hTAS}2R16) responds to β-glucosides such as salicin, and {hTAS}2R38 responds to thiourea-containing molecules such as glucosinolates and phenylthiocarbamide ({PTC}). While many substances are known to activate {TAS}2Rs, only one inhibitor that specifically blocks bitter receptor activation has been described. Here, we describe a new inhibitor of bitter taste receptors, p-(dipropylsulfamoyl)benzoic acid (probenecid), that acts on a subset of {TAS}2Rs and inhibits through a novel, allosteric mechanism of action. Probenecid is an {FDA}-approved inhibitor of the Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 ({MRP}1) transporter and is clinically used to treat gout in humans. Probenecid is also commonly used to enhance cellular signals in {GPCR} calcium mobilization assays. We show that probenecid specifically inhibits the cellular response mediated by the bitter taste receptor {hTAS}2R16 and provide molecular and pharmacological evidence for direct interaction with this {GPCR} using a non-competitive (allosteric) mechanism. Through a comprehensive analysis of {hTAS}2R16 point mutants, we define amino acid residues involved in the probenecid interaction that result in decreased sensitivity to probenecid while maintaining normal responses to salicin. Probenecid inhibits {hTAS}2R16, {hTAS}2R38, and {hTAS}2R43, but does not inhibit the bitter receptor {hTAS}2R31 or non-{TAS}2R {GPCRs}. Additionally, structurally unrelated {MRP}1 inhibitors, such as indomethacin, fail to inhibit {hTAS}2R16 function. Finally, we demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of probenecid in cellular experiments translates to inhibition of bitter taste perception of salicin in humans. This work identifies probenecid as a pharmacological tool for understanding the cell biology of bitter taste and as a lead for the development of broad specificity bitter blockers to improve nutrition and medical compliance. © 2011 Greene et al.},

We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses using genetic variants associated with the perception of bitter substances (rs1726866 for propylthiouracil [{PROP}], rs10772420 for quinine and rs2597979 for caffeine) to evaluate the intake of coffee, tea and alcohol among up to 438,870 {UK} Biobank participants. A standard deviation ({SD}) higher in genetically predicted bitterness of caffeine was associated with increased coffee intake (0.146 [95\%{CI}: 0.103, 0.189] cups/day), whereas a {SD} higher in those of {PROP} and quinine was associated with decreased coffee intake (−0.021 [−0.031, −0.011] and −0.081 [−0.108, −0.054] cups/day respectively). Higher caffeine perception was also associated with increased risk of being a heavy ({\textgreater}4 cups/day) coffee drinker ({OR} 1.207 [1.126, 1.294]). Opposite pattern of associations was observed for tea possibly due to the inverse relationship between both beverages. Alcohol intake was only negatively associated with {PROP} perception (−0.141 [−1.88, −0.94] times/month per {SD} increase in {PROP} bitterness). Our results reveal that bitter perception is causally associated with intake of coffee, tea and alcohol, suggesting a role of bitter taste in the development of bitter beverage consumption.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms responsible for taste signal transductions are very complex. A key molecule, α-gustducin, a primarily taste-specific G protein α-subunit, was discovered in 1992 and was later found to be involved in both bitter and sweet taste transduction. A proposed mechanism for α-gustducin involves coupling specific cell-surface receptors with a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase which would open a cyclic nucleotide-suppressible cation channel leading to influx of calcium, and ultimately leading to release of neurotransmitter. Although "knock-out" animals deficient in the α-gustducin gene clearly demonstrate that gustducin is an essential molecule for tasting certain bitter and sweet compounds, the precise role of α-gustducin in bitter and sweet taste is presently unclear. Indeed, there are several other signaling mechanisms in sweet and bitter taste, apparently unrelated to α-gustducin, that increase cyclic {AMP} or inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate. Thus, proposed models for α-gustducin and those found by other laboratories may be parallel and interdependent.},

	abstract = {Human bitter taste is mediated by the {hTAS}2R family of G protein-coupled receptors [1-4]. The discovery of the {hTAS}2Rs enables the potential to develop specific bitter receptor antagonists that could be beneficial as chemical probes to examine the role of bitter receptor function in gustatory and nongustatory tissues. In addition, they could have widespread utility in food and beverages fortified with vitamins, antioxidants, and other nutraceuticals, because many of these have unwanted bitter aftertastes. We employed a high-throughput screening approach to discover a novel bitter receptor antagonist ({GIV}3727) that inhibits activation of {hTAS}2R31 (formerly {hTAS}2R44) by saccharin and acesulfame K, two common artificial sweeteners. Pharmacological analyses revealed that {GIV}3727 likely acts as an orthosteric, insurmountable antagonist of {hTAS}2R31. Surprisingly, we also found that this compound could inhibit five additional {hTAS}2Rs, including the closely related receptor {hTAS}2R43. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that two residues in helix 7 are important for antagonist activity in {hTAS}2R31 and {hTAS}2R43. In human sensory trials, {GIV}3727 significantly reduced the bitterness associated with the two sulfonamide sweeteners, indicating that {hTAS}2R antagonists are active in vivo.

In the present study both oral peripheral and central cognitive strategies were used in an attempt to suppress the bitterness of caffeine. Subjects (n = 33) assessed the influence of sodium gluconate (100 {mM}), zinc lactate (5 {mM}), sucrose (125 {mM} and 250 {mM}), milk (0\%, 2\% and 4\% milk fat), and aromas (coffee, chocolate, mocha) on the bitterness of caffeine (1.5, 3 and 4.5 {mM}). The oral peripheral strategies proved most effective at suppressing the bitterness of caffeine: zinc lactate (-71\%, p {\textless} 0.05), non-fat milk (-49\%, p {\textless} 0.05), and sodium gluconate (-31\%). Central cognitive strategies were partially effective: 250 {mM} sucrose (-47\%, p {\textless} 0.05) and mocha aroma (-10\%) decreased bitterness, while chocolate (+32\%) and coffee (+17\%) aromas increased perceived bitterness. Overall, zinc lactate was the most effective bitterness inhibitor, however the utility of zinc in foods is negated by its ability to inhibit sweetness. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This chapter introduces biophysics of taste. Taste transduction is initiated when a sapid stimulus interacts with a specific receptor entity of a taste receptor cell. Taste receptor cells are neuroepithehal cells that are usually clustered into multicellular arrays called taste buds. The taste bud — being an epithehal structure — is functionally divisible into two parts: the apical region and the basal region. The apical region faces the oral cavity and is the site of interaction of most stimuli with taste receptor cells. The apical region and the lower basal region are separated by tight junctions that — as they do in all epitheha — effectively limit the diffusion of many compounds from the mucosal to the serosal space. This barrier insulates the intracellular space around the basal region from most substances that enter the oral cavity. This diffusion barrier has important implications for taste transduction because it limits the area of interaction of stimuli with the receptor cell membrane and acts as a selective filter for many ions, thereby, directly affecting the magnitude of some tastes, as is the case for salty taste transduction.},

With the exception of salicylate, the glutamate and adeno-sine monophosphate anions significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) inhibited bitterness of the pharmaceuticals more than the other anions. Also, there were several specific inhibitory interactions between ammonium, sodium and salicylate and certain pharmaceuticals. Conclusions We conclude that sodium was the most successful cation and glutamate and {AMP} were the most successful anions at inhibiting bitterness.

	abstract = {Introduction: There is a continued need for the application of flavour modifiers to improve the sensory profile of products within the functional food market. Additionally, psychophysical studies have tended to confine their scope to stimuli that elicit single sensations, and ingredients that are not always of most interest to the food industry. While basic taste-eliciting compounds and odourants have been used in functional food optimisation, modification can also include the addition of bitter-blocking ingredients. This study examines the impact that these modifiers have both alone and in conjunction with each other on the flavour of (+)-catechin containing model functional beverages. Methods: The intensities of sweetness, bitterness, astringency and aroma were rated for (+)-catechin ({CAT}) aqueous solutions alone and containing a sweetener [sucrose or rebaudioside A ({REB})], an odourant (vanilla or black tea), a bitter blocker [ß-cyclodextrin ({CD}) or homoeriodictyol sodium salt], and all combinations of each. Results: The use of sweeteners, both alone and in conjunction with bitter blockers, decreased the bitterness of {CAT}, while odourants had no effect. {CD} + {REB} significantly decreased the astringency of {CAT}. Astringency and bitterness of {CAT} was not altered by the addition of bitter blockers alone or in combination with odourants. Bitter blockers did not affect intensities of sweetness and aroma. Conclusions: The use of sweeteners in combination with bitter blockers can lower the bitterness of (+)-catechin. The addition of bitter blockers may be used without a detrimental effect on the flavour profile of model beverages. Implications: Decreasing the bitterness of plant-derived, health-promoting compounds may be achieved through the application of certain sweet eliciting and bitter-blocking compounds, which in turn, may lead to increasing the acceptability of some functional foods for bitter sensitive consumer populations.},
